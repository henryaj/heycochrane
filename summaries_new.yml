# Generated Cochrane Review Summaries
# Auto-generated from Plain Language Summaries

- question: Is the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) effective for screening anxiety disorders?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015458
  notes: |
    The STAI wasn't designed for screening and has high false positive rates, incorrectly flagging about 75% of people without anxiety. Shorter questionnaires specifically developed for anxiety screening are preferable.

- question: Do rapid tests for tuberculosis improve patient outcomes?
  answer: Partly, yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD016194
  notes: |
    Rapid nucleic acid tests (like Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) reduce the time to diagnose TB and start treatment, but they don't reduce deaths within 18 months.

- question: Do multi-component interventions help adolescents with obesity?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD016062
  notes: |
    Community-based approaches may slightly improve physical well-being and reduce BMI, but healthcare-based approaches made little difference. Evidence is limited and mostly from high-income countries.

- question: Does electrical stimulation help stroke survivors recover muscle strength?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015338
  notes: |
    Electrical stimulation shows moderate benefit for muscle strength and everyday activities like reaching and walking. However, once patients can practice activities independently, stimulation provides minimal extra benefit.

- question: Is the Beck Anxiety Inventory effective for screening anxiety disorders?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015457
  notes: |
    The BAI's utility for detecting anxiety disorders is uncertain. It misses many people with anxiety and incorrectly identifies others. Shorter screening questionnaires may be preferable.

- question: Is it safe to use lower hemoglobin thresholds for blood transfusions in premature infants?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000512
  notes: |
    Lower and higher hemoglobin thresholds show similar rates of death or disability at two years. Using lower thresholds reduces the number of transfusions without compromising outcomes.

- question: Do school meal programs improve outcomes for disadvantaged children?
  answer: Partly, yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD014794
  notes: |
    In low- and middle-income countries, school meals lead to small increases in math scores, enrollment, height and weight. However, they may have little effect on reading scores or attendance.

- question: Does manual therapy combined with exercise help with neck pain?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD011225
  notes: |
    Manual therapy with exercise provides a large reduction in pain and moderate improvements in function compared to no treatment. Compared to placebo, benefits are minimal for pain but moderate for function.

- question: Does methylphenidate (Ritalin) help children with ADHD?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD009885
  notes: |
    Methylphenidate may improve ADHD symptoms and general behavior based on teacher ratings. It may not affect quality of life and can cause side effects like sleep problems and decreased appetite.

- question: Does taking calcium supplements during pregnancy prevent pre-eclampsia?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001059
  notes: |
    Calcium supplementation shows little to no difference in preventing pre-eclampsia for women with adequate calcium diets. It may help women with low calcium intake, but overall evidence doesn't support calcium as effective prevention.

- question: Does acupuncture help with insomnia in people with cancer?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015177
  notes: |
    Acupuncture may be more effective than no treatment for insomnia in cancer patients, but evidence is weak. It was probably less effective than cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-I).

- question: Is conservative kidney management a good alternative to dialysis for older adults?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015151
  notes: |
    It's unclear whether conservative kidney management affects death rates or quality of life compared to dialysis in older adults with stage 5 kidney disease. No randomized trials exist.

- question: Is there an effective treatment for neurotrophic keratopathy?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015723
  notes: |
    Recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) may help heal corneal wounds, but evidence is uncertain. More studies with better designs are needed to determine the best treatment.

- question: Does digital technology improve treatment adherence in cystic fibrosis patients?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013733
  notes: |
    Data-tracking nebulisers with online support probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies and reduce treatment burden, but make little difference to quality of life or disease flare-ups.

- question: Do multi-component interventions help children with obesity?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD016063
  notes: |
    Healthcare-based programs may improve physical activity, and community-based programs may slightly improve quality of life, but overall effects on weight and other outcomes are limited.

- question: Are the GAD-7 and GAD-2 questionnaires effective for screening anxiety disorders?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015455
  notes: |
    GAD-7 and GAD-2 show acceptable accuracy for screening generalized anxiety disorder, but cannot diagnose anxiety disorders alone. They provide an indication of whether anxiety may be present.

- question: Can First Rank Symptoms alone diagnose schizophrenia?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD010653
  notes: |
    First Rank Symptoms correctly identify only about 57% of people with schizophrenia and incorrectly diagnose about 20% without it. They may help identify candidates for specialist evaluation but cannot be used alone.

- question: Does convalescent plasma help treat COVID-19?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013600
  notes: |
    Convalescent plasma makes no difference to deaths or clinical outcomes for people with moderate to severe COVID-19. For mild COVID-19, evidence is uncertain.

- question: Does fecal microbiota transplantation help with inflammatory bowel disease?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD012774
  notes: |
    FMT may help people with active ulcerative colitis achieve disease control, but evidence for Crohn disease is very limited. Safety and quality of life effects are uncertain.

- question: Do chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine help treat or prevent COVID-19?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013587
  notes: |
    Hydroxychloroquine does not reduce COVID-19 deaths and probably doesn't reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. It also doesn't prevent infection and may cause mild side effects.

- question: Are rapid antigen tests reliable for detecting COVID-19 in people without symptoms?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013705
  notes: |
    Rapid antigen tests detect only about 55% of COVID-19 infections in asymptomatic people. None meet WHO standards for confirming or ruling out COVID-19 in people without symptoms.

- question: Does remdesivir help treat COVID-19?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD014962
  notes: |
    Remdesivir makes little difference to deaths but may slightly improve recovery and reduce risk of needing ventilation for hospitalized patients. For non-hospitalized patients, it may reduce hospitalization risk.

- question: Do IL-6 blocking medicines like tocilizumab help treat COVID-19?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013881
  notes: |
    Tocilizumab reduces COVID-19 deaths within 28 days with high certainty, but makes little difference to clinical improvement like hospital discharge or symptom relief.

- question: Does ivermectin help prevent or treat COVID-19?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015017
  notes: |
    Ivermectin has no beneficial effect for people with COVID-19. It hasn't been tested for prevention, and medical regulators have not approved it for COVID-19 use.

- question: Does quitting smoking improve mental health?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013522
  notes: |
    People who stop smoking show greater reductions in anxiety, depression, and stress, plus improvements in positive feelings and well-being. This is true whether or not they have existing mental health conditions.

- question: Does Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) help treat COVID-19?
  answer: Yes, in certain cases.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015395
  notes: |
    Paxlovid may reduce deaths and hospitalizations for unvaccinated, high-risk outpatients treated within 5 days of symptoms. It can cause taste disturbance and diarrhea.

- question: Can symptoms alone accurately diagnose COVID-19?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013665
  notes: |
    Most individual symptoms have poor diagnostic accuracy. Loss of smell/taste is the most useful indicator, making COVID-19 five times more likely, but symptoms alone cannot reliably diagnose the disease.

- question: Do corticosteroids help treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD014963
  notes: |
    Systemic corticosteroids probably reduce deaths slightly and may increase hospital discharge rates for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Long-term effects and safety are uncertain.

- question: Do non-medicinal measures prevent COVID-19 in long-term care facilities?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015085
  notes: |
    Testing, isolation, and combination measures may prevent COVID-19 infections, but evidence quality is low. Visiting restrictions may prevent spread but can cause mental health harms like depression.

- question: Should cancer patients on chemotherapy take blood thinners to prevent clots?
  answer: Yes, in certain cases.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008500
  notes: |
    Low-molecular-weight heparins reduce blood clots in cancer patients on chemotherapy with high certainty, but increase bleeding risk. The balance of benefits and harms should be considered individually.

- question: Are rapid molecular tests useful for diagnosing tuberculosis outside the lungs?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD012768
  notes: |
    Xpert Ultra and Truenat MTB Plus tests are helpful for diagnosing extrapulmonary TB, with high accuracy for cerebrospinal fluid and rifampicin resistance detection. Sensitivity varies by specimen type.

- question: Do placebos have significant clinical effects?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003974
  notes: |
    Placebos show no dramatic general benefits, but can modestly influence subjective patient experiences like pain and nausea. Physical placebo interventions work better than pills.

- question: Are there effective interventions for increasing shared decision-making in healthcare?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006732
  notes: |
    There's no clear evidence that training programs or decision aids effectively increase shared decision-making. Many activities exist, but evidence is too weak to determine which work best.

- question: Do antioxidant supplements prevent death?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007176
  notes: |
    Antioxidant supplements showed no overall mortality benefit in 78 trials with nearly 300,000 participants. Beta-carotene and vitamin E may actually increase mortality.

- question: Does reminiscence therapy help people with dementia?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001120
  notes: |
    Reminiscence therapy may improve quality of life, cognition, communication and possibly mood in people with dementia, though all benefits are small. Effectiveness depends on delivery setting.

- question: Does animal-assisted therapy help people with dementia?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013243
  notes: |
    People with dementia who had animal-assisted therapy were possibly slightly less depressed, but there's no clear evidence for benefits on quality of life, behaviors, or daily activities.

- question: Is rehabilitation beneficial after carpal tunnel surgery?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004158
  notes: |
    There's limited and low-quality evidence for post-surgery rehabilitation benefits like splinting, exercise, or laser therapy. Decisions should be based on clinical expertise and patient preferences.

- question: Do computer-generated reminders improve healthcare quality?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001175
  notes: |
    Reminders for doctors improve quality of care by about 7-11%, helping with guideline compliance. However, evidence for improved patient outcomes is uncertain.

- question: Can urine tests diagnose endometriosis?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD012019
  notes: |
    There's insufficient evidence to recommend any urinary biomarker for diagnosing endometriosis. Laparoscopy (surgical visualization) remains the gold standard for diagnosis.

- question: Do nicotine e-cigarettes help people quit smoking?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD010216
  notes: |
    Nicotine e-cigarettes can help people stop smoking for at least six months and work better than nicotine replacement therapy. Common side effects include throat irritation, headache, and cough.

- question: Are 'red flag' screening tests accurate for detecting spinal fractures?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008643
  notes: |
    Most individual red flag tests are not accurate. Steroid use, age over 74, and recent trauma are the most useful indicators. Combining multiple red flags improves accuracy.

- question: Does exercise help women undergoing breast cancer treatment?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD005001
  notes: |
    Exercise during cancer treatment probably improves physical fitness and slightly reduces fatigue, but provides little improvement in depression or overall quality of life.

- question: Do antidepressants help people quit smoking?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000031
  notes: |
    Bupropion makes it 49-72% more likely that a person will quit smoking. However, it may increase serious unwanted effects and cause side effects leading to treatment dropout.

- question: Do stress management interventions help healthcare workers?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002892
  notes: |
    Individual stress management interventions like CBT, yoga, or relaxation may reduce stress among healthcare workers for up to one year. Evidence quality is low.

- question: Does advice from doctors help people quit smoking?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000165
  notes: |
    Even brief, simple advice from doctors increases the likelihood of quitting smoking by 1-3% beyond natural quit rates. More intensive interventions provide small additional benefits.

- question: Does cognitive behavioral therapy help with chronic pain?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007407
  notes: |
    CBT provides slight reductions in pain and distress for adults with persistent pain compared to no treatment. Benefits are smaller when compared to other treatments like exercise.

- question: Do omega-3 fatty acids help treat depression?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004692
  notes: |
    Omega-3 fatty acids show a small positive effect compared to placebo, but the benefit is unlikely to be meaningful for people with major depression. Evidence quality is low.

- question: Do psychological therapies like CBT and EMDR help with PTSD?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003388
  notes: |
    Trauma-focused CBT and EMDR are effective for reducing PTSD symptoms compared to waitlist or usual care. They appear equally effective as each other.

- question: Do patient decision aids help people make better healthcare choices?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001431
  notes: |
    Decision aids help adults choose options matching their values, increase knowledge about treatment options, and promote active participation in medical decisions with no negative side effects.

- question: Do masks prevent respiratory infections like flu?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207
  notes: |
    Wearing masks may make little to no difference in how many people catch flu-like illness. N95 respirators show similar results to surgical masks. Hand hygiene may be more effective.

- question: Does exercise-based rehabilitation help people with heart disease?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001800
  notes: |
    Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduces heart attack risk and hospital admissions, may slightly reduce death rates, and improves quality of life within 12 months.

- question: Does honey help heal wounds?
  answer: Yes, in certain cases.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD005083
  notes: |
    Honey dressings heal partial thickness burns faster than conventional dressings (4-5 days faster). Evidence is unclear for other wound types like leg ulcers or diabetic foot ulcers.

- question: Does exercise therapy help with chronic fatigue syndrome?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003200
  notes: |
    Exercise therapy probably reduces fatigue compared to passive treatments, but improvements may not last. Compared to CBT or pacing strategies, it makes little difference.

- question: Does fluoride toothpaste prevent tooth decay?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007868
  notes: |
    Toothpaste containing 1000-1250 ppm fluoride is more effective than non-fluoride toothpaste with high certainty. Higher concentrations provide slightly more protection but increase fluorosis risk in children.

- question: Does exercise help treat depression?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004366
  notes: |
    Exercise shows a moderate effect in reducing depression symptoms compared to no treatment, but is no more effective than antidepressants or psychological therapy.

- question: Do alpha2-agonists like clonidine help manage opioid withdrawal?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002024
  notes: |
    Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for managing opioid withdrawal. Methadone has fewer side effects and shorter treatment duration. Lofexidine is safer than clonidine.

- question: Do psychological therapies help parents of children with chronic illness?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD009660
  notes: |
    CBT and problem-solving therapy may improve parenting behavior and mental health, especially for parents of children with cancer or chronic pain. Effects are generally small.

- question: Does the flu vaccine protect healthy adults?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001269
  notes: |
    Inactivated flu vaccines reduce influenza cases from 2.3% to 0.9%, but 71 people need vaccination to prevent one case. Effects on hospitalization and work days lost are minimal.

- question: Does nicotine replacement therapy help people quit smoking?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000146
  notes: |
    All forms of NRT (patches, gum, spray, lozenges) increase the chance of quitting by 50-60% with high-certainty evidence. Minor side effects include skin or mouth irritation.

- question: Do flexible working arrangements improve employee health?
  answer: Yes, in certain cases.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008009
  notes: |
    Self-scheduling and employee-controlled flexibility improve blood pressure, sleep, and mental health. Employer-dictated flexibility (overtime, fixed-term contracts) shows no health benefits.

- question: Does garlic help prevent the common cold?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006206
  notes: |
    One study showed fewer colds in people taking daily garlic (24 vs 65 colds over 3 months), but there's insufficient evidence overall. More studies are needed.

- question: Does organized support help mothers continue breastfeeding?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001141
  notes: |
    Extra support from professionals or trained workers reduces the number of women who stop breastfeeding by 10-19%. Support is more effective when delivered as 4-8 scheduled visits.

- question: Do statins prevent heart disease in people without prior cardiovascular events?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004816
  notes: |
    Statins reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in primary prevention. For every 1,000 people treated for 5 years, 18 avoid a major cardiovascular event. No evidence of serious harm.

- question: Should pregnant women take vitamin D supplements?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008873
  notes: |
    Vitamin D may reduce severe postpartum bleeding and low birthweight risk, but evidence quality is low. Effects on pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth are uncertain.

- question: Does galantamine help with Alzheimer's disease?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001747
  notes: |
    Galantamine slows decline in memory and self-care abilities at 6 months. It does not help mild cognitive impairment. Users are 3 times more likely to have GI side effects.

- question: Do educational meetings improve healthcare professional practices?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003030
  notes: |
    Healthcare professionals who attend educational meetings are more likely to follow recommended practices and produce slightly improved patient outcomes.

- question: Do psychological therapies help children with chronic pain?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003968
  notes: |
    Therapies like CBT and relaxation reduce pain and disability immediately after treatment, but benefits often fade at follow-up. No effect on depression.

- question: Should breastfed babies receive supplementary foods or fluids before 6 months?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006462
  notes: |
    There's no evidence of benefit from giving water, formula, or early complementary foods to breastfed infants. Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months is supported.

- question: Do probiotics help treat acute diarrhea?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003048
  notes: |
    Probiotics probably make little to no difference to diarrhea duration or recovery. Previous positive findings were likely due to publication bias.

- question: Is methadone maintenance therapy effective for heroin dependence?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002209
  notes: |
    Methadone is more effective than non-pharmacological approaches at retaining patients in treatment and suppressing heroin use. No advantage seen for criminal activity or mortality.

- question: Do programs for people with multiple chronic conditions improve health?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006560
  notes: |
    Overall clinical outcomes show little improvement, but mental health (especially depression) may improve modestly. Targeted interventions work better than broad approaches.

- question: Does collaborative care improve treatment of depression and anxiety?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006525
  notes: |
    Collaborative care involving doctors, case managers, and mental health specialists improves depression for up to 2 years and is equally effective for anxiety.

- question: Does adding psychotherapy to antidepressants help treatment-resistant depression?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD010558
  notes: |
    Patients who receive psychotherapy plus antidepressants have fewer symptoms and are more often depression-free at 6 months than those on medication alone.

- question: Is it safe to use lower blood count thresholds for transfusions?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002042
  notes: |
    Using lower thresholds (7-8 g/dL vs 9-10 g/dL) reduces transfusions by 42% without increasing death or complications for most patients. Patients with brain injury may need higher thresholds.

- question: Do flu vaccines help prevent heart attacks and strokes?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD005050
  notes: |
    Flu vaccination may reduce cardiovascular deaths in people with heart disease. Evidence quality is moderate, and more research is needed for general populations.

- question: Do deworming drugs benefit people with HIV?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006419
  notes: |
    Deworming drugs are safe for HIV-positive individuals. Treatment of confirmed worm infections shows some viral load reduction, but effects on those without confirmed infections are minimal.

- question: Does sucrose help reduce pain in newborns during medical procedures?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001069
  notes: |
    Sucrose reduces pain during heel lances, blood draws, and injections in newborns. It doesn't work for circumcision. Minor adverse events like choking are rare.

- question: Does early intervention help prevent or treat psychosis?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004718
  notes: |
    Specialized early intervention teams improve treatment compliance and reduce dropout. However, individual interventions show inconsistent results, and long-term benefits are uncertain.

- question: Does mammography screening reduce breast cancer deaths?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001877
  notes: |
    For every 2,000 women screened over 10 years, one avoids dying of breast cancer but 10 healthy women are treated unnecessarily. Over 200 experience psychological distress from false alarms.

- question: Do antibiotics help treat acute bronchitis?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000245
  notes: |
    Antibiotics provide minimal benefit (half a day improvement over 8-10 days) and cause side effects. The modest gains don't outweigh the risks of antibiotic resistance.

- question: Does massage help with low back pain?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001929
  notes: |
    Massage may provide short-term pain relief for chronic low back pain compared to no treatment, but benefits don't persist long-term. Evidence quality is very low.

- question: Does pelvic floor training prevent urinary incontinence during pregnancy?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007471
  notes: |
    Pregnant women without leakage who do pelvic floor exercises probably report less incontinence in late pregnancy. Exercises don't help women who already have leakage.

- question: Does continuous support during labor improve birth outcomes?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003766
  notes: |
    Continuous one-to-one support leads to more spontaneous vaginal births, shorter labor, fewer cesareans, and greater satisfaction. Benefits are strongest with trained doulas.

- question: Does skin-to-skin contact after birth benefit mothers and babies?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003519
  notes: |
    Mothers practicing skin-to-skin contact are more likely to exclusively breastfeed. Babies show higher body temperatures and blood glucose levels, helping them adapt after birth.

- question: Are there effective ways to help people take medicines as prescribed?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000011
  notes: |
    Even the most effective interventions don't lead to large improvements in medication adherence. No reliable method has emerged for helping people consistently follow prescriptions.

- question: Does chemotherapy after surgery improve survival in early-stage ovarian cancer?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004706
  notes: |
    Women with early-stage ovarian cancer who receive chemotherapy after surgery have lower risk of dying within 10 years and reduced cancer recurrence.

- question: Does controlling house dust mites improve asthma?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001187
  notes: |
    Chemical and physical methods to reduce dust mite exposure (including mattress encasings) show no difference in lung function, symptoms, or medication use. Cannot be recommended.

- question: Are there effective treatments for rosacea?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003262
  notes: |
    Topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, and ivermectin effectively reduce rosacea symptoms. Oral antibiotics like doxycycline reduce pimples. Laser treatments help with blood vessels.

- question: Does advice from nurses help people quit smoking?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001188
  notes: |
    Nursing interventions increase quitting success by 29% compared to no intervention. Simpler interventions appear just as effective as more intensive ones.

- question: Is the Xpert Ultra test accurate for diagnosing tuberculosis?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD009593
  notes: |
    Xpert Ultra correctly identifies 91% of people with TB and 95% without it. It also accurately detects rifampicin resistance, allowing rapid treatment for drug-resistant TB.

- question: Do B vitamins that lower homocysteine prevent heart attacks?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006612
  notes: |
    Despite lowering homocysteine levels, B vitamins (B6, B9, B12) don't prevent heart attacks or reduce death rates. There's a small benefit for stroke prevention.

- question: Do tailored interventions improve healthcare professional practices?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD005470
  notes: |
    Interventions designed to address specific barriers show modest effectiveness compared to no intervention. Effects are variable and tend to be small to moderate.

- question: Does dietary advice help reduce cardiovascular risk?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002128

- question: Is excision or ablation better for treating ovarian endometriomas?
  answer: Excision may be better.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004992
  notes: |
    Excision may reduce painful periods, pain during sex, and cyst recurrence compared to ablation. No clear difference in fertility outcomes.

- question: Should milk feeds be advanced slowly in premature infants?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001241
  notes: |
    Slow advancement has little effect on preventing bowel inflammation or death. It may increase infections because infants stay on IV nutrition longer.

- question: Does aerobic exercise help with fibromyalgia?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD012700
  notes: |
    Walking, swimming, and other aerobic exercises improve quality of life, pain, and physical function in fibromyalgia. Improvements are generally small (7-11 points on 100-point scales).

- question: Do mobility exercises help recovery after hip fracture surgery?
  answer: Yes.

- question: Do SSRIs improve recovery after stroke?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD009286
  notes: |
    SSRIs don't reduce disability or dependency after stroke. They may reduce depression risk by 25%, but increase seizure and fracture risk.

- question: Does audit and feedback improve healthcare professional performance?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000259
  notes: |
    Audit and feedback improves performance by about 6%. Works best when comparing to top performers, focusing on important areas, and including actionable tips.

- question: Do modifications to whole brain radiotherapy improve outcomes for brain metastases?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003869

- question: Are there effective medications for treating alcohol withdrawal?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008537
  notes: |
    Benzodiazepines perform better than placebo for preventing seizures during alcohol withdrawal. Evidence for other medications like anticonvulsants is limited.

- question: Can clinical symptoms diagnose Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD009175
  notes: |
    M. pneumoniae cannot be reliably diagnosed in children based on symptoms and signs alone. Clinical features are not sufficient to guide antibiotic prescribing decisions.

- question: Should episiotomy be used routinely during childbirth?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000081
  notes: |
    Selective episiotomy (only when necessary) results in 30% fewer cases of severe perineal trauma compared to routine use. No benefits of routine episiotomy found for mothers or babies.

- question: Do omega-3 supplements during pregnancy reduce preterm birth?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003402
  notes: |
    Omega-3 fatty acids reduce preterm birth and low birthweight. However, they may increase pregnancies continuing beyond 42 weeks. No clear effects on maternal depression or child development.

- question: Does aromatherapy help with nausea after surgery?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007598
  notes: |
    Aromatherapy may reduce need for anti-nausea medications, but doesn't reliably eliminate nausea itself. Isopropyl alcohol inhalation showed faster relief than standard drugs.

- question: Are short-acting insulin analogues better than regular insulin?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003287
  notes: |
    Short-acting insulin analogues are almost identically effective to regular human insulin for blood sugar control and have similar rates of low blood sugar episodes.

- question: Can diet and exercise prevent type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003054
  notes: |
    Diet plus physical activity reduces diabetes risk from 26% to 15%. Diet alone or physical activity alone don't show clear benefits. Long-term outcomes need more research.

- question: Does telemedicine improve health outcomes?
  answer: Yes, in certain cases.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002098
  notes: |
    Telemedicine improves blood sugar control in diabetes and performs similarly to face-to-face care for mental health. Results for heart failure and other conditions are mixed.

- question: Does exercise help people with dementia?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006489
  notes: |

    Topical imiquimod is no more effective than placebo and causes more skin reactions. No treatment shows convincing effectiveness. Natural resolution remains the best approach.

- question: Do antioxidant supplements improve male fertility?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007411
  notes: |
    Antioxidants may increase live birth rates from 16% to 17-27%, but benefit disappeared when low-quality studies were excluded. Evidence is inconclusive.

- question: Is laparoscopic surgery better than open surgery for appendix removal?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001546
  notes: |
    Laparoscopic surgery reduces pain, wound infections, and hospital stay (by 1 day), with faster return to activities (5 days earlier). May increase internal abdominal infections.

- question: Do gels and fluids prevent scar tissue after gynecological surgery?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001298
  notes: |
    Gels and fluids reduce visible adhesion formation, but there's no evidence they improve fertility or reduce pelvic pain. Practical clinical benefits remain unproven.

- question: Is sustained lung inflation better for newborns needing breathing help?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004953
  notes: |
    Sustained inflation makes little to no difference to survival. It may reduce ventilation need, but overall evidence doesn't support its use over standard methods.

- question: Does acupuncture help people quit smoking?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000009
  notes: |
    Acupuncture shows weak short-term benefit but no lasting effect at 6+ months. It's less effective than nicotine replacement therapy and no better than counseling alone.

- question: Should infants be exclusively breastfed for six months?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003517
  notes: |
    Six months of exclusive breastfeeding reduces gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. Mothers experience delayed menses and faster weight loss. No clear benefits for allergies.

- question: Do drainage tubes after breast cancer surgery reduce complications?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006823
  notes: |
    Drains reduce fluid collection (seroma) by about half. However, patients stay in hospital 1.5 days longer. No difference in infection or lymphedema.

- question: Does St. John's wort help treat depression?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000448

    St. John's wort is similarly effective as standard antidepressants with fewer side effects. Products vary greatly and can interact with other medications.

- question: Does behavioral therapy help with chronic low back pain?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002014
  notes: |
    Operant and cognitive behavioral therapies are more effective than waiting list in the short term. No clear advantage over group exercise in the longer term.

- question: Does protective ventilation with lower volumes improve respiratory failure outcomes?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003844
  notes: |
    Lower tidal volume ventilation decreases short-term deaths by 26% in patients with acute respiratory failure. Long-term effects are uncertain.

- question: Does information-only education improve asthma outcomes?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001005
  notes: |
    Information-only education doesn't reduce hospitalizations, doctor visits, or medication use for asthma. It may improve symptom perception but not overall health outcomes.

- question: Does electrotherapy help with neck pain?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004251
  notes: |
    Some modalities like TENS might be more effective than placebo, but evidence quality is very low. No definite statements can be made about effectiveness.

- question: Should metastatic breast cancer be treated first with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy?
  answer: Hormonal therapy first is preferred.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002747
  notes: |
    Chemotherapy has higher response rates but similar survival. Hormonal therapy has fewer side effects. Recommended first except for rapidly progressive disease.

- question: Do counseling interventions help heart attack patients quit smoking?
  answer: Yes, in certain cases.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006886
  notes: |
    Interventions lasting more than one month help patients quit (46% vs 37% success). Brief single sessions don't work. Long-term benefits beyond 12 months are unclear.

- question: Does chlorpromazine help treat schizophrenia?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000284
  notes: |
    Chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves symptoms, but causes significant side effects including sedation, movement disorders, and weight gain.

- question: Does non-invasive brain stimulation help with chronic pain?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008208
  notes: |
    rTMS and tDCS may produce small, short-term pain reductions, but effects are not clinically important. Evidence quality is very low. Seizures have been reported with rTMS.

- question: Is single inhaler therapy better than separate inhalers for asthma?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007313
  notes: |
    Single inhaler therapy probably reduces flare-ups requiring oral steroids. Evidence for reducing hospitalizations is weak, and more people discontinue due to side effects.

- question: Does exercise help with weight loss?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003817
  notes: |
    Exercise combined with diet produces greater weight loss than diet alone. Higher intensity is more effective. Exercise improves cardiovascular risk factors even without weight loss.

- question: Does chondroitin help with osteoarthritis?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD005614
  notes: |
    Chondroitin may provide small, short-term pain relief (about 10 points on 100-point scale). Benefits disappear in high-quality studies. Evidence is inconsistent.

- question: Do psychosocial interventions help pregnant women quit smoking?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001055
  notes: |
    Counseling, feedback, and financial incentives are effective. Health education and peer support are not clearly effective. Interventions reduce low birthweight by 17%.

- question: Does individual counseling help people quit smoking?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001292
  notes: |
    Individual counseling from trained therapists increases quit rates from 7% to 10-12%. More intensive counseling shows modest additional benefits. High-quality evidence.

- question: Do antibiotics help with the common cold?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000247
  notes: |
    Antibiotics provide no benefit for the common cold or acute purulent rhinitis. They cause significant adverse effects and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Routine use is not recommended.

- question: Does long-term hormone therapy benefit postmenopausal women?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004143
  notes: |
    Combined hormone therapy reduces fractures but increases breast cancer, stroke, and blood clot risks. Estrogen-only therapy reduces fractures with less cancer risk but may increase stroke. Benefits depend on individual circumstances.

- question: Do e-cigarettes help people quit smoking?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD010216
  notes: |
    Nicotine e-cigarettes help people quit smoking more effectively than nicotine replacement therapy. About 8-11% quit with e-cigarettes vs 6% with patches or gum. They work better than non-nicotine e-cigarettes.

- question: Does colchicine prevent heart attacks and strokes?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD014808
  notes: |
    Low-dose colchicine reduces heart attack and stroke risk in people with cardiovascular disease. However, it doesn't reduce death risk. May cause mild gastrointestinal side effects.

- question: Does HPV vaccination prevent cervical cancer?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015363
  notes: |
    HPV vaccination reduces cervical cancer by about 80% when given before age 16. It also reduces pre-cancerous lesions and genital warts. Evidence from 132 million people shows it's safe with no increased infertility risk.

- question: Do interventions help people quit vaping?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD016058
  notes: |
    Text messaging and varenicline may help people quit vaping, but evidence is limited. More research is needed on effective vaping cessation methods. Only 15 small studies available.

  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001125
  notes: |
    Cyproterone acetate is similar to most alternatives for treating hirsutism. It shows modest advantages over spironolactone at 6 months. Larger studies needed for firm conclusions.

- question: Does non-invasive ventilation help people with cystic fibrosis?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002769
  notes: |
    Evidence is uncertain whether CPAP or BiPAP helps people with cystic fibrosis. Some find it helpful while others discontinue due to discomfort. High-quality long-term studies are needed.

- question: Does breast surgery improve survival in metastatic breast cancer?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD011276
  notes: |
    Breast surgery does not improve overall survival for women with metastatic breast cancer. It controls local disease but doesn't prevent spread. May have modest benefit for luminal-type tumors specifically.

- question: Does surgery for septate uterus improve pregnancy outcomes?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008576
  notes: |
    Hysteroscopic septum resection shows little to no difference in live birth rates compared to watchful waiting. May even increase miscarriage risk. More research needed.

- question: Do immunosuppressant eye drops help blepharitis?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013550
  notes: |
    Topical corticosteroids and cyclosporine make little to no difference for blepharitis symptoms. Conventional lid hygiene and warm compresses remain the valid treatment approach.

- question: Do decongestants or antihistamines help ear infections in children?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015839
  notes: |
    Evidence is unclear whether decongestants or antihistamines help acute middle ear infections in children. Studies were too small and poorly designed for reliable conclusions.

- question: Does nucleoplasty help cervical disc herniation?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD011852
  notes: |
    Nucleoplasty may reduce neck and arm pain at 3 months compared to conservative treatment, but shows little effect on function or quality of life. Insufficient evidence to support its use.

- question: Does semaglutide help with weight loss?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015092
  notes: |
    Semaglutide produces more weight loss than placebo over 24+ months. However, more people discontinue due to side effects long-term, and it shows little effect on quality of life or cardiovascular events. 17/18 studies were manufacturer-funded.

- question: Does molnupiravir help treat COVID-19?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015381
  notes: |
    Molnupiravir probably makes little to no difference in death or hospitalization rates for mild to moderate COVID-19 outpatients. Improves early viral clearance but benefit diminishes by day 14.

- question: Does skin-to-skin contact after birth help newborns?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003519
  notes: |
    Skin-to-skin contact promotes exclusive breastfeeding and improves infant temperature and blood sugar levels. Recommended for all healthy full-term and late preterm infants regardless of birth mode.

- question: Does acupuncture help polycystic ovary syndrome?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007689
  notes: |
    Acupuncture shows little or no effect on live birth, pregnancy, or ovulation rates compared to sham acupuncture. May actually increase adverse events. Current evidence doesn't support use for PCOS fertility.

- question: Are restrictive blood transfusion thresholds safe?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002042
  notes: |
    Waiting to transfuse until hemoglobin is 7-8 g/dL (vs 9-10 g/dL) doesn't increase death, heart attack, stroke, or infection risk. Reduces transfusions by 42%. Exception: brain injury patients may benefit from liberal approach.

- question: Does intravenous immunoglobulin help myasthenia gravis?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013801
  notes: |
    IVIg may slightly improve symptoms for up to 6 months, but effects may not be clinically meaningful. Causes headaches in up to 1/3 of patients. Plasma exchange may be more beneficial. Low-quality evidence.

- question: Is propofol better than traditional sedatives for colonoscopy?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006268
  notes: |
    Propofol may improve recovery time and patient satisfaction with little effect on completion rates or complications. Non-anesthesiologist administration is as safe as anesthesiologist-directed.

- question: Does cognitive behavioral therapy help insomnia in cancer patients?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015176
  notes: |
    CBT-I may slightly reduce insomnia severity and improve sleep quality in cancer patients, but findings are very uncertain. Benefits are modest and depend on availability, cost, and patient preference.

- question: Does cryotherapy help after knee replacement surgery?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007911
  notes: |
    Cold therapy may reduce blood loss by 264mL and pain by 1.6 points (out of 10), but these benefits may be too small to justify its use. Effects on function and adverse events are uncertain.

- question: Does continuous combined hormone therapy protect against endometrial cancer?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000402
  notes: |
    Continuous combined hormone therapy has similar endometrial hyperplasia risk to placebo. Unopposed estrogen increases risk at all doses. Sequential combined therapy also increases risk. Cancer effects are uncertain.

  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015464
  notes: |
    The effect of vitamin B2 supplements on blood pressure is uncertain. Only 4 small studies with 374 people available. Large, well-conducted trials are needed.

- question: Do treatments help impulsive behaviors in Parkinson's disease?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015046
  notes: |
    We don't know if medications (amantadine, naltrexone, clonidine) or CBT help reduce impulsive-compulsive behaviors in Parkinson's. Studies are too small and limited. More research needed.

- question: Does liraglutide help with weight loss?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD016017
  notes: |
    Liraglutide increases the proportion achieving 5%+ weight loss. However, effects on quality of life and mortality are uncertain, and it may increase adverse events. 22 studies were manufacturer-funded.

- question: Do nicotine pouches help people quit smoking?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD016220
  notes: |
    Uncertain if nicotine pouches help quit smoking. May have lower quit rates than e-cigarettes. No serious short-term harms found, but evidence is very limited. More research urgently needed.

- question: Should older adults take blood pressure medication?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD000028
  notes: |
    Blood pressure medications lower death risk and probably reduce heart attacks and strokes in adults 60+. Thiazide diuretics are effective first-line treatment. Higher withdrawal rates due to side effects.

- question: Do work breaks prevent musculoskeletal problems?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD012886
  notes: |
    Not enough good-quality evidence to draw reliable conclusions. Additional breaks may reduce back pain in office workers, but evidence is very uncertain. Larger studies needed.

- question: Are there effective medications for cannabis use disorder?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008940

- question: Does palivizumab prevent RSV in high-risk children?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013757
  notes: |
    Systemic palivizumab reduces RSV hospitalizations and wheezing days in high-risk children (premature, heart/lung problems). Little effect on mortality. Intranasal form may actually increase hospitalizations.

- question: Is CPAP better than theophylline for preterm apnea?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD001072
  notes: |
    Very uncertain evidence from a single 40-year-old study with 32 infants. Both treatments largely replaced by modern nasal CPAP and caffeine. No meaningful difference detected.

- question: Do vaginal lasers help stress urinary incontinence?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013643

    Not enough evidence to support midazolam use in babies, especially preterm. Higher neurological complications vs morphine. Longer ICU stays. No studies measured pain relief or brain development effects.

- question: Do phosphate binders help kidney disease patients?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006023
  notes: |
    Sevelamer may reduce death vs calcium binders in dialysis patients. Both sevelamer and lanthanum cause less hypercalcemia. No clear cardiovascular benefits. Constipation and nausea common.

- question: Is peritoneal drainage better than surgery for infant bowel disease?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006182
  notes: |
    Peritoneal drainage shows little difference in death or mental impairment vs laparotomy. Associated with increased cerebral palsy risk. Half of drainage patients still need surgery later.

- question: Does sustained lung inflation help newborn resuscitation?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD004953
  notes: |
    Sustained lung inflation makes little to no difference in newborn mortality. May slightly reduce need for mechanical ventilation. No evidence to support its use over standard resuscitation.

- question: Does manual rotation help during labor?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD009298
  notes: |
    Manual rotation may result in little to no difference in operative delivery rates. Cannot confirm if it prevents cesarean or instrumental births. No deaths reported. More trials needed.

- question: Do perioperative interventions help pelvic prolapse surgery?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013105
  notes: |
    Limited evidence to recommend any perioperative treatment. One key finding: catheters left >24 hours increase UTI risk 3-8 times. Insufficient data for most interventions studied.

- question: Is surgical or medical abortion safer in second trimester?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006714
  notes: |
    Both surgery and medicines may be safe and effective. Medical abortion may have higher incomplete abortion risk and slightly more bleeding. Surgical may have less pain. Very low quality evidence.

- question: Does rituximab help myasthenia gravis?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD014574
  notes: |
    Very uncertain effects on symptom severity and daily activities. Probably causes large reduction in relapse needing rescue therapy (220 vs 490 per 1000). Only 2 studies with 99 participants.

- question: Do skin products prevent incontinence-associated dermatitis?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD011627
  notes: |
    Very uncertain if any treatment works better than others. Specialized cleansers might be better than soap/water. Combining cleansers with moisturizers might help. Very low certainty evidence.

- question: Does virtual reality help stroke rehabilitation?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD008349
  notes: |
    VR may slightly improve arm function and balance, probably reduces activity limitation. Best as supplement to usual care, not replacement. Minor side effects like headaches. Moderate to low quality evidence.

- question: Do infant probiotics prevent allergies?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006475
  notes: |
    Probiotics may slightly reduce eczema by age 2 but show little to no difference for asthma, allergic rhinitis, or cow's milk allergy. Effects on food allergies uncertain. No serious adverse effects.

- question: Does progestogen prevent recurrent miscarriage?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003511
  notes: |
    Progestogen probably makes little to no difference to miscarriage or live birth rates for women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. Regardless of delivery method (oral, injection, vaginal).

- question: Do corticosteroids help treat sepsis?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD002243
  notes: |
    Corticosteroids probably reduce death at 28 days and may shorten ICU/hospital stays. Little effect on mortality beyond 3 months. May increase blood sugar, infections, and muscle weakness.

- question: Should preterm infants with PDA be treated early?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013278
  notes: |
    Early drug treatment probably makes little to no difference in mortality. Very early ibuprofen may increase death in extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks). Only benefit: 5 days shorter hospitalization.

- question: Do diet and activity programs prevent obesity in toddlers?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015326
  notes: |
    Combined dietary/activity interventions may have very modest BMI benefits at 15+ months. Diet or activity alone show little effect. Modest improvement considered meaningful from public health perspective.

- question: Is warfarin better than aspirin for heart failure?
  answer: No.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003333
  notes: |
    Warfarin and aspirin probably both reduce mortality with little difference between them. However, warfarin probably doubles major bleeding risk. No clear advantage to prescribing warfarin over aspirin.

- question: Do topical antibiotics help chronic ear infections?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013051
  notes: |
    Very uncertain if topical antibiotics reduce ear discharge. Some indication they may help vs placebo. Insufficient evidence on which antibiotic works best. Harmful effects poorly documented.

- question: Do GnRH agonists help premenstrual syndrome?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD011330
  notes: |
    GnRH agonists improve PMS symptoms but many discontinue due to menopausal side effects (hot flushes). Long-term use problematic due to bone loss. Add-back therapy shows low-certainty benefit.

- question: Do fertility preservation methods work for cancer patients?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD012891
  notes: |
    Ovarian suppression may reduce ovarian insufficiency. Insufficient evidence on controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for live births. No studies directly compare methods. More research needed.

- question: Does yoga help cancer-related fatigue?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015520
  notes: |
    Yoga after anticancer therapy probably reduces short-term fatigue. Effects during treatment are uncertain. Long-term benefits unknown. More research needed on sustainability.

- question: Do strengthening exercises help patellar tendinopathy?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013078
  notes: |
    Evidence is very uncertain. May make little to no difference to function compared to no treatment or injections. Unclear if better than surgery for return-to-sport.

- question: Do robotic devices help stroke patients walk again?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006185
  notes: |
    Robotic devices plus physiotherapy probably help walk independently after stroke, especially in first 3 months. For every 9 treated, 1 extra person walks independently. No speed improvement.

- question: Do atypical antipsychotics help autism symptoms?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD014965
  notes: |
    Risperidone and aripiprazole may reduce irritability in autistic children. Lurasidone probably makes little difference. Uncertainty about aggression, weight gain, and effects in adults.

- question: Is telemedicine safe for medical abortion?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013764
  notes: |
    Telemedicine for early pregnancy medical abortion may have similar safety, effectiveness, and acceptability as in-clinic care. Post-abortion telemedicine actually improves follow-up adherence.

- question: Are surgical drains beneficial after pancreatic surgery?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD010583
  notes: |
    Unclear if drains reduce complications after pancreatic surgery. Early drain removal probably slightly reduces abdominal infection in low-risk patients. Very uncertain evidence overall.

- question: Is one FET preparation cycle better than others?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD003414
  notes: |
    Insufficient evidence to recommend natural cycle, hormone therapy, or ovulation induction for frozen embryo transfer. Low quality evidence across all comparisons. Larger studies needed.

- question: Do vaccines help blood cancer patients prevent infections?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015530
  notes: |

- question: Does ustekinumab help Crohn's disease?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD007572
  notes: |
    Ustekinumab is more effective than placebo at achieving remission (74% vs 87% failure at 8 weeks). Probably doesn't cause increased severe adverse effects. Insufficient evidence vs other medications.

- question: Does sustained-release naltrexone help opioid dependence?
  answer: Yes, mildly.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006140
  notes: |
    Better than standard care for reducing illicit opioid use. Probably slightly worse than methadone/buprenorphine. Requires prior detoxification. More research needed on long-term outcomes.

- question: Does the DASH diet prevent heart disease?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD013729
  notes: |
    Unclear if DASH diet reduces heart attacks, strokes, or cardiovascular death. Studies were small with short follow-up. No studies in people with existing heart disease. Larger long-term studies needed.

- question: Do typhoid conjugate vaccines prevent typhoid fever?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD015746
  notes: |
    Typhoid conjugate vaccines may cause a large decrease in typhoid fever with protection lasting up to 4 years. Little difference compared to other typhoid vaccines. More research needed in endemic countries.

- question: Does melatonin help cancer patients?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD010145
  notes: |
    Effects on quality of life and sleep are unclear. Probably reduces fatigue and may reduce nausea when added to standard treatment. Insufficient data to recommend for or against use.

- question: Is one treatment best for ulnar nerve compression at the elbow?
  answer: Maybe.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006839
  notes: |
    Simple nerve release, repositioning, and endoscopic surgery show similar results. Written info alone as effective as info plus splints/exercises for mild cases. Dextrose injections may help.

- question: Do PPIs prevent ulcers from NSAIDs?
  answer: Yes.
  url: https://www.cochrane.org/CD014585
  notes: |
    PPIs probably reduce new ulcers (36 vs 119 per 1000 people) and slightly decrease indigestion compared to placebo. May increase ulcers compared to H2-blockers or misoprostol.
